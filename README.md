# move_window
A console program for resizing and moving windows that do not allow changing their size

You can find the window by its title, or provide its handle (which you can get from Spy++ or using the FindWindow function).
If you get the "Access is denied" error, it means the program needs admin rights to control that process' windows (some windows can be controlled with normal rights).
